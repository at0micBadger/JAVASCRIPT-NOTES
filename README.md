# JAVASCRIPT-NOTES

This Repository was created to track and store information on my understanding of modern Javascript.

a FEW NOTES ARE NEEDED ON HOW THIS SECTION IS ORGANIZED.

A numbered file ex: 08 <filename> simply refers to a file on basic theory.

a number that starts with a P is a general program corresponding to the current level of theory.
a PX file is experimental. slightly ahead of the current theory level.
